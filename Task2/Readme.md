#  PentestPixel: Image Encryption and Decryption Tool

PentestPixel is a Python-based tool for encrypting and decrypting images using an advanced permutation-based algorithm.
It features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, allowing users to easily select image files for encryption and decryption.
The tool ensures images are processed in RGB mode and saves the results in the 'images' directory.
Users can encrypt and decrypt images by selecting files through an intuitive file dialog, which supports all file types.
This project demonstrates basic image manipulation and encryption techniques in Python, providing a foundation for more advanced cryptographic applications.
